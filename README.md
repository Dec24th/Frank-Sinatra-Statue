# Frank-Sinatra-Statue
# A newly built statue of Frank Sinatra was unveiled to the public on December 12th 2021.
# It would have been Frank's 106th birthday.
# I occasionally contribute to Google Maps by adding photos.
# and since this was a new statue, I want to be one of the first to contribute to the map's location with a photo of the statue
# And seeing that you can "Add a Website" to a location on Google Maps, the idea of making a website for a statue came to me.
# So here is a website for the Statue! 
# A good way to practice making websites, updating them, and contributing to my portfolio!
